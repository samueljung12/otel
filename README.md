# Welcome!

This is a sandbox exercise where we will compare how APM traces look like when instrumented with Otel SDK vs. DD Agent/tracer

The application is composed of a frontend and backend.

Frontend:
- React JS application

Backend:
- Python Flask application

Both the frontend and backend are spun up in a docker compose network and therefore are able to communicate easily. 

# Enjoy!
